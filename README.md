## Concept

Flag Man is a tech demo / video game made within the Godot game engine.
It is an action platformer with a unique mechanic where-by you, as the player, can throw flags as projectiles and use frost magic to freeze them mid-air to create platforms and complete puzzles (puzzles not implemented yet).

## Personal Notes

> I have tried to implement everything to be as modular as possible so as to be able to build the game faster.

> I think it worked out well in my opinion because I've gotten a decent amount done for my time, considering this is my first time using Godot;
Also considering I also made (basically) all of the assets (music/art included).

> I am really happy with how far I have come and although I have suffered difficulties along the way, I believe I am much better now at breaking down problems into more manageable parts and/or learning how to structure projects at-least even marginally better (although my code in some places is a mess...).

## GDD

Let it be known that I have included a [Game Design Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document)

## Story and Art
I started first with just a little guy waving flags around.
I thought, what if I made the main character a little martian guy.
Then I created the art for the mountainous area, based on some reference images of mars and my own experience visiting the Grand Canyon, which definitely helped.
And after that I thought, people always talk about lizard men from mars in conspiracy theories, what if I just make those guys the antagonist. And thus the lizardmen were born.
I won't go too deep into lore in this as its mainly just to see if i've learned computer science, not storytelling, so...

## Mechanics
When I first started the project I had a plethora of ideas considered for the main mechanic but I ended up choosing the frozen projectile concept because it was the most extensible for new mechanics, like quenching fire, freezing liquids, etc.

#### Struggles and Shortcomings
One of the first things I had trouble with was learning the editor, all of the little quirks. Once I got over the hurdle of tutorial hell, things were actually a lot easier once I sat and actually picked apart problems, reading the proper wiki's when needed.
AI and Navigation are still some things that need work but I just couldn't get them the way I wanted within the timespan I am afforded currently.
Animations still need polish.

## Programming
Let's get down to the nitty gritty.

Many challenges were confronted in this project including but not limited to...
- Inheritence V.S. Composition
- Proper Class Structure
- Vectors
- Physics
- Ooodles and Ooodles of Object Oriented Programming
- State Machines ([Animation Trees](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.html), Custom State Machines)
- [A* pathfinding algorithms](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_astar2d.html) [-----](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0x5fj4PqP4) (Even though i ended up using the built-in navigation agents, which still use A*, its just more under the hood)
- [Save Systems](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/saving_games.html#json-vs-binary-serialization)

These were the most difficult for me to grasp, but there are plenty more things.

## Composition
As opposed to an is-a relationship between classes and its parents, nodes of the composition design technique have a has-a relationship, where-by classes can have instances of other classes inside of them.
So instead of being strictly stuck to inherit all parts of its parent, it can just instance little pieces of information from various classes, increasing modularity.
Godot handles this nicely with its node-based structure, ensuring maximum modularity between components. It is so easy to take each individual part and make something entirely new with just a few nodes.

## Vectors and Normals
Vector math was a doozy, I suck at it. I even had to watch like 3 or 4 videos to even get a grasp on it. But it's just magnitude from a direction, it kinda just clicked after awhile.
In a similar vein, normals were equally confusing but they are just vectors pointing perpendicular to a plane. They help to orient things like lighting in the proper direction and ensures that on what needs to be rendered, is.

## Save Systems
Save Systems are deceptively tricky to work with.
In Godot, [Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html) and [ConfigFiles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_configfile.html) are not safe for saving and loading data due to code execution.
So we have to come up with a different solution... 
Hmm, whats good at storing data and relatively safe.
Oh, i know! JSON
So we just use the [built-in json support](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_json.html) to save whatever data we need via...
    Dictionaries inside each node that needs to be saved that lists what data needs to be saved
    A global SaveHandler, which does just as the name implies
    Inside the SaveHandler, some helpful [signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html) which tell each node with save data to run their co-responding save functions and use the returned dictionaries from said functions to store the save data.

And there we go!
(This took WAY longer than I thought it would.)
